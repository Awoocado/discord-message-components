# @discord-message-components/core

The core package used across the other `@discord-message-components` packages. Used for sharing utility functions, assets, and styles.

## Notes

This package currently installs `discord-markdown` from [`danktuary/discord-markdown`](https://github.com/Danktuary/discord-markdown), a fork of [`brussell98/discord-markdown`](https://github.com/brussell98/discord-markdown). This is temporary until the package is moved into this monorepo.
